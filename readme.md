# Be positive (B+) App

This application was developed to help people find a blood donor easily and also helps those who want to volunteer to donate their blood as well as charities to help patients.

## Usage

The user registers himself in our database by recording his name, blood type and age. When entering the main page, you can see other donors divided by blood groups, to make it easy to find the appropriate blood type for the patient with ease and make contact with him, who in turn appears as a notification to the donor with the possibility of accepting or rejecting the donation.
